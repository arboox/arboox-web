        <p style="font-family: 'Neurial Grotesk', system-ui; position: relative; text-align: left; color: #ABABAB; margin-top: -24px;">At ARBOOX™, we care about people's safety and the protection of their data. In this privacy policy, we'll explain you what we do and what we don't do with the data you provided when you signed up. If your questions were not solved with our privacy policy, you can always contact our support team via <a href="mailto:arbooxapp@gmail.com" style="color: #ABABAB;">e-mail</a>. We're active from Monday to Friday from 8 AM to 12 PM CST (Central Standard Time).</p>

        <h3>
          Article 1. How we manage your data.
        </h3>
        <br>
                <p style="font-family: 'Neurial Grotesk', system-ui; position: relative; text-align: left; color: #ABABAB; margin-top: -24px;">When you sign up, you are asked to provide an e-mail address, a username and a password. We store the information provided in a secure, private database that only ARBOOX™ employees can access. Your ARBOOX™ Account is not public, so you don't face any risks like receivng hate or suggestive comments, or being 'hacked'.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>
          Article 2. What we do with your data.
        </h3>
        <br>
                <p style="font-family: 'Neurial Grotesk', system-ui; position: relative; text-align: left; color: #ABABAB; margin-top: -24px;">Although not everyone can create a public profile in ARBOOX™, people are still required to sign up. This helps us to mantain a constant count of our users, and also to prevent bots from joining the platform. It's important for you to know that we don't sell your data to anyone in this planet or in other galaxies, since our two main sources of income are collaborations with brands and advertisements, not the selling of your e-mail address.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>
          Article 3. What we don't do with your data.
        </h3>
        <br>
                <p style="font-family: 'Neurial Grotesk', system-ui; position: relative; text-align: left; color: #ABABAB; margin-top: -24px;">As mentioned before, we don't sell your data. We don't send you e-mails unless they're important (new logins, sign up confirmation). We don't follow you around internet because, again, we don't really want to make money out of e-mail addresses, that's weird, and wrong. In case you signed up with a phone number, you won't receive SMS messages from us, never. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>
          Article 4. How your data is used in ARBOOX™ Stores, Galleries and In-place AR Experiences.
        </h3>
        <br>
                <p style="font-family: 'Neurial Grotesk', system-ui; position: relative; text-align: left; color: #ABABAB; margin-top: -24px;">When you make a purchase at an ARBOOX™ Store, you enter to an AB Gallery, or you scan an In-place AR Experience code, we will track the interaction. However, you're only asked to provide your ARBOOX™ username when completing a purchase at our official stores.</p>
