      <p style="font-family: 'Neurial Grotesk', system-ui; text-align: left; font-size: 18px;">
        Hello everyone. Today, we're so excited to release ARBOOX™ worldwide. In the past two months, we've been working to create an AR app with a seamless user experience, but also, an app that has a purpose.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        ARBOOX™ is an AR app that lets people place objects in the real world. Users can pick from a wide collection of AR experiences, and new ones are added every week. You can also watch videos, play games and read stories. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <i style="color: #CCCCCC;">"Alright. It's an AR app, nothing new. But do I really need it?" — You</i>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        The answer to that question is yes. Why? Because there's even more than that. Although it might seem like this is an app made out of sh*tpost, it actually solves real world problems.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        If you asked me what is the app's main purpose, I would probably had even told you the frames per second in which the app can run on your phone. I'm not going to get into details, so instead I will give you some examples of situations in which ARBOOX™ can be useful, because overall, it seems like the app will just ocupy 36.6 megabytes in your device.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Situation No.1: Shopping.</b>&ensp; If you thought maybe the app would let you see Saladet Tomatoes with the power of your camera, well, you're partially right. You won't exactly be able to view tomatoes in AR, but yes, you'll be able to preview, as I like to say, products from home decoration stores as well as brands selling electronic devices, house plants, etcetera. To put it plain, you can view anything that can be placed in the floor (like a table), or anything that can be placed on top of that table in augmented reality.
        <br>
        <br>
        Now, lets say you can't get to the nearest IKEA because, I don't know... there's COVID! Well, you guessed it, ARBOOX™ has a solution to this kind of problem. And even if there wasn't COVID, trust me, there will be, eventually, something stopping you to go and eat those delicious meatballs from IKEA.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <i style="color: #CCCCCC;">"So... no fast fashion is allowed because that harms the place in which the sons of your sons could live one day" — That's my quote</i>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Situation No.2: You're bored.</b>&ensp; I couldn't think about something more authentic for you to download ARBOOX™, boredom is the perfect excuse. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Alright, you're bored and don't know what to do. (When I was bored in August 2020 I got the idea of making this app so don't blame me please). Lets say a surprise in those moments of boredom would feel great. Well, ARBOOX™ has a lot of surprises and yes, they're all for you. Go ahead and open a duck, a cat, a whale or even a Fiat 600 in AR. Remember, new experiences are added weekly, and the fun will never end! (Unless my storage ends, but that can be fixed quickly).
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Situation No.3: You hate museums, or just don't like reading a lot.</b>&ensp; I hated museums when I was 6 years old, and somehow, those memories came to me when I was coding.
        <br>
        <br>
        Let me tell you, ARBOOX™ also has a solution to this problem, if it can be considered one. There are <a href="https://arboox.ca/anchors" style="text-decoration: underline;">Anchor experiences</a>, in other words, you can go to a museum ask someone at the box office, if you are so lazy as not to look for it yourself, for the "arboox poster". Once you're in the poster, open your device's camera app and scan a code. Instantly, you'll see an object in AR, and with it, at least you'll learn something new.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Well, as you can infer, ARBOOX™ does a lot of things. And the best part: it is free, forever. You can signup and download super easy today!
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        If you've already signed up or dowloaded the app, I want to thank you personally for supporting this project. (It's the founder who wrote the article. I'm the founder).
